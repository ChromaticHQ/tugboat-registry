                Tugboat has successfully cloned your git repository, but we need a bit more information in order to
                display your previews. Run through the following checklist below and you willll be on your way!

            <h2>Is your project in a /docroot folder?</h2>
            <p>
                Tugboat looks for a folder named "docroot" in your repository to serve content from. This is a common
                standard, but many projects have their own preferences. If your content root is in a different location
                you have a couple of different options.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Move your content to /docroot in your repository. This is the most straightforward fix for Tugboat,
                    but can be problematic if your repository has already been deployed elsewhere. If you choose this
                    option, be sure to follow up on other deployments to make sure things still work.

                    Create a build script. Build scripts can be used to perform any number of customizations to your
                    preview. But, if all you need is to point apache to a different location in your repository, a
                    simple script like the following may be all you need. Add this to a file named <tt>Makefile</tt>
                    in the root of your repository. Make sure the indent is a TAB, and not multiple spaces.

<pre class="code">
<code>tugboat-init:</code>
<code>  ln -sf $TUGBOAT_ROOT/public_html /var/www/html</code>
</pre>

                    Read below for more information on build scripts.

        <div>
            <h2>Do you need a build script?</h2>
            <p>
                It is very likely that your repository will need a build script in order to work correctly with
                Tugboat. The fact that you are seeing this page indicates that a build script is probably your next
                step.

                Tugboat uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a> to provide the opportunity to
                run your own scripts at different points of a preview's life cycle. Check out our
                <a href="https://docs2.tugboat.qa">documentation</a> for details on how to create a Tugboat build
                script.

                <!--#set var="dashboard" value="https://${TUGBOAT_DASHBOARD}/${TUGBOAT_PREVIEW_ID}" -->
                Remember to rebuild the <a href="<!--#echo var="dashboard" -->">preview</a> after you make any
                changes to your build script. This will happen automatically for previews built for pull requests (or
                merge requests), but needs to be done manually for other previews.
