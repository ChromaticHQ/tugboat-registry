                      Tugboat needs to know which services to make available for 
                      your repository. This usually consists of a web server, 
                      like Apache or Nginx, and maybe a database or key/value 
                      storage service. Visit your 
                      <a href="<!--#echo var="settings" -->">repository settings</a> 
                      to configure the services that your application needs in 
                      order to operate correctly.
