                    You are almost there! We just need a bit more information before Tugboat can build previews for your
                    repository. Run through the following checklist and you will be on your way!

                        Tugboat needs to know which services to make available for your repository. This usually consists of
                        a web server, like Apache or Nginx, and maybe a database or key/value storage service. Visit your
                        <a href="<!--#echo var="settings" -->">repository settings</a> to configure the services that your
                        application needs in order to operate correctly.
